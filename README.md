### Contact Management System Application

This program is a command-line based Contact Management System developed in Python. It allows users to manage their contacts by adding, editing, deleting, searching, displaying, exporting, and importing contact information. The system ensures data integrity and provides a user-friendly interface for interaction.

### Features:
1. **Add New Contact:** Users can add a new contact by providing their full name, phone number, email address, and address. Input validation ensures that all required fields are properly filled.
2. **Edit Existing Contact:** Users can edit the information of an existing contact, including their name, phone number, email address, and address. Flexible options allow users to choose which information to modify.
3. **Delete Contact:** Users can delete a contact from the system by providing their email address. Confirmation messages ensure accurate deletion.
4. **Search Contact:** Users can search for a contact by entering their email address. If the contact exists, their information is displayed.
5. **Display Contacts:** Users can view all contacts currently stored in the system. This feature provides an overview of all contacts at once.
6. **Export Contacts:** Contacts can be exported to a text file named "contact_list.txt". The exported file includes comprehensive contact information for each contact.
7. **Import Contacts:** Users can import contacts from a text file named "contact_list.txt" into the system. This feature facilitates easy migration of contacts between systems.
8. **Quit:** Users can exit the program gracefully at any time.
